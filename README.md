🌐 Google Clarity Web3 Procurement Contract

This project demonstrates how **procurement contracts** (e.g., by Google-scale organizations) can be handled in **Clarity smart contracts** using **Web3 transparency, fairness, and immutability**.  

Vendors submit bids on projects, evaluators assign quality scores, and the contract automatically selects the winner based on a **weighted scoring system** that balances cost and quality.


✨ Features

- **Project Creation** → An owner (e.g., Google) posts procurement projects with budgets and details.  
- **Vendor Bidding** → Vendors submit proposals and bid amounts.  
- **Evaluator Scoring** → Evaluators assign quality scores to each bid.  
- **Weighted Winner Selection** → The contract calculates `(quality * 1000) / cost` to balance **value vs. price**.  
- **On-chain Transparency** → Every project, bid, score, and winner is permanently recorded.
